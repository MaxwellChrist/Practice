When going through the training I received for React, we did not really cover the new update to React (v18). I wanted to build something that would allow me to learn and explore more about the most current version instead of relying on the concepts that are now outdated. At the time of writing this, you can still use the older versions of react. I just wanted to be able to learn these concepts myself and be able to implement them in this simple form I'm building.
